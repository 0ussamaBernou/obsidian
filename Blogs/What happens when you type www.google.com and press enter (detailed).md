First things first computers don't understand domain names, domain names are made for humans only, so a domain name needs to be translated to an ip address

## ==DNS request==

the browser sends a dns request to a dns server, if domain name exists the dns server responds with the ip address associated with it.

Now that the browser got the ip address, it send and http request to that ip address
in order for this request to reach the destination server, it need to be encapsulated to be transfered by routers then de-encapsulated for the server to be able to get it
